# A Comparative Analysis of Exposure to Respiratory Hazards and School Performance in Southern California.

## Intro
This section shall contain the literature review elements in addition to reasoning behind the research topic selection

Research suggests that minorities such as Hispanic and African-American children tend to be exposed to air pollution more than their white children counterparts (Chakraborty & Zandbergen, 2007; Jianghong & Lewis, 2014; Reichmuth, David, 2019). In a study of more than 150,000 public school children from Orange County, Florida, revealed this. In addition, the student revealed that African American children were exposed more to air pollution in comparison to Hispanic Children (Chakraborty & Zandbergen, 2007; Jianghong & Lewis, 2014). Furthermore another study assesses that, "On average, African American Californians are exposed to PM2.5 pollution that is 43 percent higher than that for white Californians" and ""Latino Californians are exposed to PM2.5 pollution 39 percent higher, on average, than that for white Californians" (Reichmuth, David, 2019). Research would indicate that communities that come from low-income hosueholds are exposed to air pollution are higher rates. Specifically, one study's measure of pm or partical matter (1) amongst the "lowest-income households in the state" lived where the particle matter of 2.5 pollution is 10 percent higher than the state average" (Reichmuth, David, 2019.)


Air toxins from industrial pollution have significantly adverse effects on human health outcomes. *insert more information about air toxins + citations)* Riverside County, the largest county in California's Inland Empire, is known for its high levels of air pollution and air toxics exposure. The effects of such exposure to human health such as respiratory function have been thoroughly examined, with the region notably containing rates of pediatric asthma that exceed California health and safety standards. (*insert citations here*) There is existing literature linking air toxics exposure to decreased academic performance. In a study of school children in China, researchers found a significant association between air pollution, particularly levels of NO2, and poorer results on neurobehavioral tests designed to measure the children’s sensory, motor, and psychomotor functions (Wang et al., 2009). It is important to note, however, that exposure to pollutants and decreased academic performance are not necessarily the result of SES variables. A recent study assessing the association between environmental toxicants and _____

## Importance:

The problems surrounding environmental air hazards and the impact on school performance is a highly neglected and under-researched exploration. Past literature review show individual studies in specific geographic regions testing the association between environmental inequality and that of academic performance indicators. Our group study supplements prior studied evidence that there is an envionmental ascription in the sense that it can exert negative influence on academic performance in children and ultimately contribute to social inequalities. (Lucier, Rosofsky, London, Scharber, Shandra, 2011). We reveal that some schools and the students enrolled have an inherit attribute with these polluted environments.

## Data
This section shall contain information around the data sets, the methods, and why particular methods were used

(Preeti & Laura) 
The data tha was used in our methods includes the EJScreen from the U.S. environmental Protection Agency; specifically from the year 2020. The EJScreen data has valuable information on environmental justice data . The variable that was selected for the purposes of our map is the Air Toxics Respiratory Hazard Index. Furthermore, we refined the EJscreen 
Include how the index:  
Shortcomings: 

The second dataset was used was the NCES for the school district data from 2018 to 2019 academic school year. Specifically, this dataset entails the locations of the schools in a given school district.  

The third dataset, we implemented into our project is the ACS or American Community Survey from the year 2018. This dataset entails demographic variables []

The four dataset that we complied is the SEDA data; this data entails standardized test scores that were collected from the 3rd grade to the 8th grade in math and reading language arts or RLA. The school years range from 2008 to 2009 and 2017 to 2018. 
Why did we select the outcome variable how was it measured/estimated in the code? 

## Methods: [Laura & Wajiha] 
Spatial analysis 
The research methods includes layering data; specifically, the EJSCREEN dataset was merged to the 
Then the...

Furthermore, our research methods in the project included using the veroni method.  
The reason why we choose the veroni method over using a simple map is because the method is consistent in evenly mapping out the centroids of polygons based off of the location of nearby polygons.    
Additional benefits to using the veronic method is [Explain how the veroni method is used in the project]. 
Although, the veroni method is useful for the intended purpose of our project, it is important to relate the limitations of using this method. The limitation to using the veronic method is that the formula to make this method assumes that neighborhood movement remains constant. The second limitation is...

## Results (pending) 
This section shall contain the results as well as data visualizations, tables and analysis.
1. Visual legends overlaying  
2. Veroni results 
3. Correlation and Causation 

## Policy Recommendation (generalize)
(Wajiha/Laura) 
The analysis can be contributed to other counties, we have given step by step analysis. Great to extend to other areas . Laying a foundation for future researchers. 

## Discussion and conclusions 
(Salvador & Esteban) 
Restate the importance/relevance of the study:  
This section shall discuss whether the results were in line with existing research and anticipated results, how the study may be improved, policy recommendations (with research backing them) and highlighting the need of further research regarding environmental exposure and academic performance
